## Problems Solved âœ…

1. **[ZigZagSequence](ZigZagSequence.md)**  
   In this challenge, the task is to **debug** the existing code to successfully execute all provided test files.

   Given an array of $n$ distinct integers, transform the array into a zig zag sequence by permuting the array elements. A sequence will be called a zig zag sequence if the first  elements in the sequence are in increasing order and the last  elements are in decreasing order, where $k = (n+1)/2$. You need to find the lexicographically smallest zig zag sequence of the given array.

2. **[TowerBreakers](TowerBreakers.md)**  
   Given the values of $n$ and $m$, determine which player will win. If the first player wins, return $1$. Otherwise, return $2$.

3. **[CaesarCipher](CaesarCipher.md)**  
   Complete the Caesar Cipher.
